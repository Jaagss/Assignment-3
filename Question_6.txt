Advantages of using OO
1. Code written can be reused easily in later ventures
2. Debugging the code is easier as when Object-Oriented Programming is applied, the user knows exactly where to look into the code whenever there is an error. 

Advantages of using Dictionaries
1. We can store value and key together in a dictionary
2. Searching for a key in dictionary is very fast

Disadvantage of using OO
1. The length of the programmes developed using OOP language is much larger than the usual approach
2. OOPs take time to get used to it. 

Disadvantage of using dictionaries
1. Dictionaries are unordered.
2. They take more space than other data types

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two
approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 10000
2. Time by OO: 0.006342411041259766
3. Time by dictionary: 0.024642467498779297
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: 0.25737727123

Performance comparison for search operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two
